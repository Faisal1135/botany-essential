Membranes of different species contain characteristic types of polar lipids in proportions that are probably genetically determined. Davson and Danielli, in 1935, proposed that membranes are made up of a central region consisting of phosphoglycerides and an outer denser region composed of proteins. The phosphoglyceride molecules were believed to be arranged in two rows with their hydrophilic polar heads towards the outer edges and their hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails in the centre. Although it is still accepted that the two rows of phosphoglyceride molecules form the backbone of the membrane it is believed that globular proteins, rather than forming a distinct outer layer, actually penetrate the whole width of the membrane in places (see diagram). Both the phosphoglyceride molecules and the proteins are thought to be able to move laterally giving the membrane fluid-like properties. This hypothesis of membrane structure is termed the fluid-mosaic model. Plasma membranes are selectively permeable, controlling the passage of materials into and out of the cell. The proteins of the membrane include enzymes and compounds of the active transport system. Water and nonpolar molecules that dissolve in the phosphoglyceride layer pass readily through the membrane. The membrane is relatively impermeable to charged ions, which enter the cell by means of the active transport system.

This property of the molecule explains the observation that red and far-red light are mutually antagonistic in their effects, the response of the plant often depending on the last type of radiation received.

This is especially true in the case of rapid light-mediated responses, e.g. leaf movements in Mimosa pudica.

The * resolving power  of an electron microscope is far greater than that of a * light microscope  because the wavelength of an electron beam is 0.005 nm as compared to about 600 nm for yellow light. In theory this should mean that objects only 0.0025 nm apart could be distinguished. However in practice aberrations in the lenses (electromagnetic fields), deterioration of the specimen during observation, and other technical difficulties reduce resolution to about 1 nm. This is still some 300 times better than that using light. Two principal types of electron microscope are used. In the transmission electron microscope (TEM) the electron beam, which is usually produced from a tungsten filament, passes through a condenser lens system and is focused onto the specimen, which is normally an ul-trathin section held on a fine copper grid. The image of the specimen, focused by the objective lens and magnified by the projector lens, is then projected onto a fluorescent screen or photographic plate. The entire microscope column is under high vacuum to prevent the beam of electrons from being scattered by the molecules in air. The casing of the microscope must therefore be completely dry and the specimen dehydrated. The magnification is altered and the\u00a0\u00a0 focusing\u00a0\u00a0 adjusted\u00a0\u00a0 by\u00a0 varying\u00a0\u00a0 the current through the electromagnetic lenses. coatingIn the more recently developed scanning electron microscope (SEM), commercially available since the mid 1960s, the surface of the specimen is observed and a three-dimensional appearance is obtained. The beam of incident electrons ejects secondary electrons and back-scattered electrons from the specimen, which is usually treated by * low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. These reflected electrons are collected by a scintillator and an image is built up on a high-resolution cathoderay tube as the electron beam passes over the specimen in a sequence of scanning movements. The resolution obtained in the scanning electron microscope is lower than in the transmission electron microscope but is constantly being improved upon and instruments capable of resolving 2 nm are now available. Some electron microscopes are capable of operating in several different modes, either as scanning or transmission electron microscopes or in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) mode. Microscopes combining optical and transmission electron microscopy are also available for making high and low magnification observations of the same specimen. coatingSince the electron beam produces x-rays from the specimen, attachments are also available that permit the composition of the specimen, or part of it, to be determined by comparison of the radiation produced. stainingOne of the main limitations of the electron microscope apart from its expense is that living material cannot be viewed.

However the mutation giving a colourless aleurone layer occurs more frequently, about 110 times in every million replications of the locus. Reversions of a mutant gene to a normal gene occur less frequently. The low frequency of spontaneous gene mutations may be attributed to the great stability of DNA. One reason for the occurrence of spontaneous mutation is that all the bases can also exist in very rare isomeric forms. Thus while adenine normally pairs with thymine, in its rare isomeric form adenine will pair preferentially with cytosine.

Occasionally the fungus is a basidiomycete or a deuteromycete (imperfect fungus).

In eukaryotes, it is mostly confined to the chromosomes, where it is found in association with basic proteins called histones.

Typically a DNA molecule consists of two polynucleotide chains, forming a right-handed helix with\u00a0 one coil\u00a0 positioned\u00a0 more or less underneath the other (the double helix, see diagram). There are only four types of nucleotides in the polynucleotide chains, although each chain can be thousands of nucleotides long. Each nucleotide is constructed from deoxyribose sugar, esterified to phosphate and a base. The base may be adenine or guanine (the purine bases), or cytosine or thymine (the pyrimidine bases). The sequence of nucleotides in a polynucleotide chain ultimately specifies the sequence of amino acids in proteins, i.e. forms the basis of the genetic code. The phosphate groups are on the outside of the helix. Each polynucleotide chain is established and held together by the formation of further ester bonds between the phosphate group of one nucleotide and the deoxyribose sugar of an adjacent nucleotide in the same chain. For this reason, each polynucleotide is sometimes described as having a 'sugar-phosphate' backbone (see diagram). The two polynucleotide chains in a double helix are antiparallel, i.e. in one chain the sugar-phosphate backbone is composed of 3'-5' phosphodiester bonds, while in the other, it is composed of 5'-3' phosphodiester bonds. The bases are on the inside of the helix, and each forms hydrogen bonds with a complementary base on the other helix. By the formation of these hydrogen bonds, the two helices are held together.

Florigen has yet to be isolated from plants although there is much circumstantial evidence for its existence.

Thus the stimulus must be transported from the leaves to the apex. The flowering stimulus can be transferred, by grafting, from one plant to another. If leaves from short-day plants grown under short days are grafted onto long-day plants grown under short days then the stimulus from the grafted leaves will promote flowering in the long-day plant. Such work shows that florigen is similar in long- and short-day plants. The rate of florigen movement has been measured by removing the leaves from a plant at varying intervals after exposure to an appropriate photoperiod and noting whether flowering still occurs. In some plants the rate appears to be slower than that expected if transport were via the phloem.

They are applied by immersing the specimen in a solution of the dye. Nonvital staining is the colouring of dead tissue; vital staining is the staining of living tissue without harming or killing the cells. histochemistryMost stains are organic salts consisting of a positive and negative ion. In acid stains the colour comes from an organic anion (negative ion). Such stains (e.g. eosin) tend to colour the cytoplasm of cells. In basic stains the colour comes from an organic cation (positive ion). Such stains, e.g. haematoxylin, tend to colour the nuclei. Neutral stains are mixtures of acid and basic stains and are used to stain both nucleus and cytoplasm. An example is Leishman's stain, which is made by mixing the acid stain eosin with the basic stain methylene blue in alcohol. Materials in cells can be described as acidophilic if they are receptive to acid dyes; basophilic if receptive to basic dyes; and neutrophilic if receptive to neutral dyes. Certain dyes need an additional substance (a mordant) to bind them to the tissue. The combination of the dyestuff and the mordant is called a lake. Iron alum, for instance, is used as a mordant for haematoxylin. In its absence, the tissue will not take up the stain. Various complex techniques are used for staining different types of tissue for light microscopy. Counterslaining (or double staining) is the application of two stains in sequence so as to colour different parts of the specimen. For example, safranin is often counterstained with light green. Overstaining occurs when too much stain is taken up by the specimen. In such cases, part of the stain is removed by a solvent - a process known as differentiation. metachromatic stainBy analogy with stains for the light microscope, electron stains are substances used with specimens for electron microscopy.

The water in the soil contains dissolved mineral substances and gases that can be taken up by plant roots.

The air present in the spaces between the soil particles is generally richer in carbon dioxide and poorer in oxygen than atmospheric air.

The ribosomes of mitochondria and chloroplasts are smaller (70S) than those in other parts of the cytoplasm (80S) but similar in size to those of prokaryotes.
